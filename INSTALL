## Installation for Windows ##

If you are using the zip file to run the Desktop App, you will need to run the
"postInstall.bat" file to install the required dependencies. The file is in
"PhoneGap-win32-ia32/resources/app.asar.unpacked/bin". Right click on the file
and select "Run as administrator", once the script has finished running you will
be able to use the app.
